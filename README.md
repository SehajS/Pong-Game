# Pong Game

The code contains a basic implementation of pong game, which is created using turtle library. It comes pre-installed with every basic python installation. Otherwise, one can use

    pip install turtle

# Rules

There are two paddles, a left paddle (corresponding to Player A) and a right paddle (corresponding to Player B), and a ball. The ball moves throughout the screen, while the paddles can only move vertically.

To move the left paddle up, press "w". Press "s" to move the left paddle down.
To move the right paddle up, press "Up". Press "Down" to move the right paddle down.

If a paddle, misses the ball, the opposite paddle gains a point.
