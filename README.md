# Pong Game

The code contains a basic implementation of pong game, which is created using turtle library. It comes pre-installed with every basic python installation. Otherwise, one can use

    pip install turtle

# Rules

There are two paddles, a left paddle (corresponding to Player A) and a right paddle (corresponding to Player B), and a ball. The ball moves throughout the screen, while the paddles can only move vertically.

- Press "w" key to move the left paddle up.

- Press "s" key to move the left paddle down.

- Press"Up" arrow key to move the right paddle up.
